# Predictive Modeling, Deep Learning, NLP
The machine learning (NLP, Deep Learning, Predictive Modeling) projects completed in 2023 fall, including 

## Deep Learning
  1. Customized Canday Detector (Resnet50, Manually Labelled Training Images by Myself through Label-Studio) -> The fine-tuned model is also accessible through HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/tatakea-jin/detr-resnet-50_finetuned_image/tree/main

  2. Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders -> Analyze a short video and detect the frames where something unusual happens by checking if the loss of the model exceeds a pre-defined threshold

## NLP
  1. Customer Review Web Scrapping
  2. Sentiment Classification on Customer Reviews (tf-idf with n-gram BoW representation)
